## Project Requirements

- Design a differential drive robot using URDF with a camera and a LIDAR sensor
- Create a new world environment in Gazebo
- Create a custom robot ROS package to hold the robot, a white ball, and the world
- Create a `ball_chaser` ROS package to hold all C++ nodes
- Write a `drive_bot` C++ node that will provide a ball_chaser/command_robot service to drive the robot by controlling its linear x and angular z velocities
- Write a `process_image` C++ node that reads your robotâ€™s camera image, analyzes it to determine the presence and position of a white ball

<!-- The requirements of this project were met as approved by Udacity's reviewers. -->

## Design Process

- Designed a differential drive robot using Solidworks (STLs available inside `drive_bot/meshes`) then exported it to URDF using [Solidworks to URDF Exporter](https://github.com/ros/solidworks_urdf_exporter)
- Tweaked URDF to fix axis and coordinate systems, added camera and LIDAR sensor to robot model
- Designed a maze world using Gazebo's Building Editor based on [this maze](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sample-maze-used-in-computer-simulations_fig6_315969093)
- Wrote C++ nodes `drive_bot` and `process_image` to drive the robot's wheels based on the position of the white ball as obtained by the latter node
- Packaged launching into a single launch file for each of the ROS packages
